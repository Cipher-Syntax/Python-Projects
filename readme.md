# Python Programs

Welcome to my collection of Python programs!! This repository showcases various projects I've worked on to enhance my programming skills and explore different concepts in Python. Below is a brief description of each project.

## Projects

### 1. To Do List Program (./to_do_list_program.py)
A simple program that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. Users can add, remove, and view their tasks.

### 2. Rock Paper Scissors Game (./rock_paper_scissor_game.py)
An interactive game where users can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The program randomly selects the computer's choice and determines the winner.

### 3. Random Guessing Number (./random_guessing_number.py)
A fun guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

### 4. Collatz Sequence (./collatz_sequence.py)
An implementation of the Collatz conjecture, which generates the sequence for a given starting number. The program displays each step of the sequence until it reaches 1.

### 5. Singly Linked List Program (./singly_linked_list_program.py)
A program that implements a singly linked list with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, updating, and sorting.

### 6. String, List, Tuple, and Dictionary Methods Demo (./string_list_tuple_dict_methods.py)
This project demonstrates various methods for manipulating strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries in Python.

### 7. Advanced Calculator (./advanced_calculator_project.py)
This project includes a calculator that performs:
- Basic Arithmetic Operations
- Advanced Arithmetic Operations
- Trigonometric Functions
- Statistical Functions

### 8. Contact Manager with CRUD Functionality (./contact_manager.py)
A Contact Manager program with CRUD functionality that includes options to
- Add Contacts
- Display Contacts
